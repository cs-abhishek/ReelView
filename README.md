Hi everyone! 👋 We're Abhishek Kumar, Zaara Tahreem, Noorie Parveen, and Amna Hasaan. Our project, ReelView, is a cross-platform movie browsing, and review watching app built using Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose. This project gave us hands-on experience with real-world app development, API integration, UI/UX design, and building for Android, iOS, and desktop using a single codebase. It's been an exciting journey exploring modern development tools and bringing our ideas to life! 🌟🎬

ReelView is a Kotlin Multiplatform showcase that utilizes Compose Multiplatform to build apps with unified UI across Android, iOS, and desktop environments (Linux, Windows, macOS). A single codebase is used to develop all platforms.

It integrates the TMDB API for retrieving and presenting film content.

⚠️ This repository is a work in progress. It serves as a demo for Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform basics and is not optimized for production deployment.

🏗️ Project Breakdown
There are two primary modules in this app:

1. composeApp
   This module contains the reusable logic and UI code.

androidMain – Android-specific implementations and configurations.

iosMain – Handles iOS-specific logic and app startup routines.

desktopMain – Contains desktop app entry point and platform-specific details.

commonMain – Shared logic used by all platforms:

domain – Core app logic and models.

data – Manages API and cache layers.

ui – Cross-platform UI components via Compose.

di – Dependency injection (Koin).

2. appiOS
   Dedicated module for iOS, bridging the shared logic to native code.
